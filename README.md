# Security Graph - Altimeter Universe

## Security Graph

Security Graph is a data architecture that provides real-time views of assets
and their relationships. Assets to be considered include software, cloud
resources and, in general, any piece of information that a security team needs
to protect.

Security Graph not only stores the catalog of active assets and the assets
assigned to teams. It also keeps a historical log of the multidimensional
relationships among these assets, including their attributes relevant to
security.

## Altimeter Universe

The Altimeter universe takes the AWS accounts stored in the [Security Graph -
Asset Inventory] and uses Tableau [Altimeter] to gather information about the
AWS assets in these accounts.
